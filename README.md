Hi Coders and others too like me :-), I am new to all these, but it seems interesting.
I want to learn things that really matters. Till now, i am standing on 0.
You know what the real problem is, I don't understand what I should learn that will help me in future.
So I am going step by step, whatever free code camp is teaching me.
